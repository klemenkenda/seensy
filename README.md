[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klemenkenda/seensy.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/klemenkenda/seensy)

Energy related stream processing engine. It consumes streaming sensor data  and other static or streaming data via predefined API (REST). It is possible to load:

* real-time sensor data with different time resolution
* delayed sensor data with different time resolution
* forecast data (for example weather forecasts)
* static features (calculated for past, present and future)

For real-time or timeline coherent data stream aggregates are calculated online. API exposes all the raw and aggregated data (historic and realtime).

For more data check our Wiki page at https://github.com/klemenkenda/seensy/wiki/Configuration.
